=== Markup ===

== Emphasis ==

The BEST way to create emphasis in a txt document is to use capitalization.

The hxt spec has no specific support for other kinds of emphasis markup, but recommends that hxt clients keep it simple:

- Single asterisks for *bold* text
- Single underscores for _italic_ text

== Links ==

Links should always be included in their raw format: https://example.com/
