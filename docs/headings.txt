=== Headings ===

The hxt recommendation for headings is to use three levels with a descending number of equals signs at either side.

=== Heading 1 ===

== Heading 2 ==

= Heading 3 =

If you need additional heading levels, simply add more equals signs to your top level headings and work down from there.

====== Heading 1 ======

===== Heading 2 =====

==== Heading 3 ====

=== Heading 4 ===

== Heading 5 ==

= Heading 6 =

This approach differs from those used by markup syntaxes like Markdown and AsciiDoc, which each use ascending numbers of markers.

hxt's philosophy is simple: More markers, more emphasis, bigger heading. The bigger your heading, the more visible it is when scrolling through your txt documents.
